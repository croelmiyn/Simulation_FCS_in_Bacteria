# Simulation_FCS_in_Bacteria

This project carries out simulations of diffusing fluorescent proteins in a bacteria-shaped volume excited by a Gaussian shaped laser beam
and calculates the Intensity Correlation Function that would have been obtained from the corresponding Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy experiment.

The code is implemented in java 8.0 as an ImageJ Plugin (v1.49 or higher). 
Dependent libraries are 
- JTransform 2.4 from Piotr Wendykier: https://github.com/wendykierp/JTransforms.git
- IJUtilities, compiling several utility classes for parallel computing by Piotr Wendykier, available at: https://github.com/croelmiyn/SimulationsChemotaxis.git/tree/master/packages/
